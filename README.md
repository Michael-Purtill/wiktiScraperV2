Languages are automatically generated by reading the HTML of Wiktionary.

Choose a lemma:

Generate unmatched words - scrapes each word in the lemma into an unitialized form, later to be defined into your prefered structure:

Choose a word - words in this lemma with like-HTML structures are hidden and will have your changes applied to them as well:

Define structure - choose which elements from the page to store in the database, giving them your desired name:

Generate definitions - Any pages with structures the same as you have defined will be saved in the database as queryable objects according to your input:
